    <h1>Brief Personal Story </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Gebrehiwot Tekulu, and I am originally from Tigray, Ethiopia, East Africa. Not just born and raised there but I also completed my elementary, highschool, and undergrad education in there. Up on my graduation I joined Commercial Bank of Ethiopia in which I worked for almost four years.Then in 2011, I moved to the United States after winning the Diversity Visa (DV)lottery.

        Here, in the states I have been working in the hospitality services and then in a biotech company, in Boston, Massachusetts. Besides, I was attending in another undergrad program in Biomedical Engineering. After taking about 71 credit hours in this field though, I switched my area of interest and joined Maharishi University to pursue my study in Software Development.
